Digital Logic Design 

in this repository you can find Digital Logic Design projects with Modelsim and also Quartus

there is a folder for gate level design in Modelsim where you can understand the Transistor Level of Computer Architecture 

the Transister level time delay is mostly (3,4,5)

Most of the projects are simulated by both Modelsim and Quartus to implement the delay times of Altra hardwares 

Post Synthesis results are available in the related folder 

Before simulating the .vo file don't forget to add Modelsim libraries
